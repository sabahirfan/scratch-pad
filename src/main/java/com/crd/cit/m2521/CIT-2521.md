Write a new jva method that takes matching config a JSON file and Crims JSON object and returns the template string.

We have two config files, one is crimes json which contains the values for the fields defined in matching-config.json.
i.e. "field": "security.secTypCd" means we have to fetch the value from crims json with path security.secTypCd

1. Read the matching-config.json into a Java object DocumentInfer.
2. Load the crims.json into Map of JsonNode object or something generic and better.
3. Matching config has node, which contains array of fields and array of children. 
4. Each fields need to populate it's crimsValue from crims.json 
5. Find the values for all the items in fields array. field[0].field and field[1].field from crims.json file and populate these.
6. Now we have populated all the crimsValues in DocumentInfer object.
7. Now we need to go through the DocumentInfer object.
8. Find the matching values under the children, this should compare node.fileds.name == children.values.name and node.fileds.crimsValue == children.values.value
9. If all the items in fields array has matching children values as per logic in step 8, then return the template
10. If there is no template i.e template is null, then there will be a node similar to parent one.
11. Then use recursion to go through this node with same logic from step 8.
12. We need to find and return the remplate based on these matching fields and values.


Context: DocumentInfer data model is here:

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude;
import lombok.Data;

import java.util.List;

@Data
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
public class Field {
private String name;
private String field;
private String crimsValue; // this value will be populated from crims.json based on the field property of this class.
}

@Data
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
public class Value {
private String name;
private List<String> value;
}

@Data
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
public class ValuesNodes {
private List<Value> values;
private NodeCondition node;
private String template;
}

@Data
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
public class NodeCondition {
private List<Field> fields;
private List<ValuesNodes> children;
}

@Data
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
public class DocumentInfer {
private NodeCondition node;
}

Crims.json:
For this one, we should expect result = "Sabah with USD" from the template.
---
{
"security": {
"secTypCd": "Sabah",
"localCurrency": "USD",
"index": "Manjit",
"paymentFreq": "Monthly"
}
}

matchin-config.json:
---

{
"node": {
"fields": [
{
"name": "secTypCd",
"field": "security.secTypCd"
},
{
"name": "localCurrency",
"field": "security.localCurrency"
}
],
"children": [
{
"values": [
{
"name": "secTypCd",
"value": "Sabah"
},
{
"name": "localCurrency",
"value": "GBP"
}
],
"template": "Sabah with GBP"
},
{
"values": [
{
"name": "secTypCd",
"value": "Sabah"
},
{
"name": "localCurrency",
"value": "USD"
}
],
"template": "Sabah with USD"
},
{
"values": [
{
"name": "secTypCd",
"value": "Manjit"
},
{
"name": "localCurrency",
"value": "GBP"
}
],
"node": {
"fields": [
{
"name": "index",
"field": "security.index"
},
{
"name": "paymentFreq",
"field": "security.paymentFreq"
}
],
"children": [
{
"values": [
{
"name": "index",
"value": "Manjit"
},
{
"name": "paymentFreq",
"value": "Monthly"
}
],
"template": "Monthly-template"
},
{
"values": [
{
"name": "index",
"value": "Manjit"
},
{
"name": "paymentFreq",
"value": "Weekly"
}
],
"template": "Weekly-template"
},
{
"values": [
{
"name": "index",
"value": "*"
},
{
"name": "paymentFreq",
"value": "*"
}
],
"template": "wild-card-template"
}
]
}
}
]
}
}


The logic to find the template is as following:

For the matching config field, find the value in Crims JSON. 
i.e. In this example field name secTypCd, will find the field security.secTypCd in Crims JSON, and the value will be "Sabah" || "Manjit".
If the fields array node contains more than one item, then match both. i.e. we have "name": "secTypCd" and "name": "localCurrency" then both of these needs to be matched with relevant fields in Crims JSON. And we will have two values to match in this case in matcing JSON children values array.

Now for this value in step 1. We will find the matching child in matching Config under children node. If the value was "Sabah" in step 1 then we will return template value which is  "Sabah with GBP".

If there is no template found under main children node for the found value in step 1, then there will be child nodes to go through. i.e. if the value found in step 1 is Manjit, there is no template, but it has node for name  "currency" and field "security.localCurrency". And it's value will be either
"USD" || "GBP".  we will find the matching child in Matching Config under children node. if it matches with USD then USD-template will be returned, if GBP is matched then GBP-template will be returned. If no matching template found then check if there is wild card (*) is defined under children, use this as default template.

If any matching Fields set match more than 1 children values set (e.g. more than one wild cards defined under children), then throw exception, Invalid MatchinConfig, more than one match defined.

this process should be recursive throughout the matching path, until no match ie no template (throw exception) or template reached.
